                            I just want to take this moment to let you know how much you mean to me. Every day with you is special, but today, I want to remind you just how loved and appreciated you are. Your presence brings happiness, and I’m truly grateful to have you in my life.
                            I hope this day fills your heart with warmth, love, and joy. No matter what, know that you are always in my thoughts and heart.

                            With love,
                            Hugh Vergara
